# **ZPRINTF**

void ZPRINTF(const bool is_stdout, const char* format, ...)

## *How to use:*

*** Will add more info soon ***

## *Description:*

Currently Tested on:
- MacOS (C++(gcc))
- Windows (C++(mingw64), tested quickly on MSVC, but since this is no .sln file, i tested the .cpp/.h)

ZPRINTF is a versatile logging and printing Class for C++ programs. Was made to use at 42 Programming school, since they don't allow us to use most C function in their C++ courses.

This lack alots of feature like the formatting and quite a few variable identifier, feel free to do pulls requests
